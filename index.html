      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am curious person; I've never met a subject I didn't get along with. I am also a hopeful software engineer.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born on a ranch in Denton, TX, but grew up in Carmel, IN.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a passionate guitar player and love to produce music (still learning the latter). I also love messing around with computers, taking them apart, putting them back together, as well as just building things in general. Most of all though, I love to read and spend time with my wife and dogs. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A Product Development Manager, with a focus on User Interface design, because I find so many ridiculously unintuitive designs, every day, that I feel it must be cleaned up.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Kansas City, Mo</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To learn more about the all powerful internet and to get my foot in the door of the tech industry. I'm tired of other people making all the software and tools I use; I want to be part of the creative process.</p>
